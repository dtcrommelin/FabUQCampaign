# FabUQCampaign
This plugin runs the samples from an ![EasyVVUQ](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ) campaign using ![FabSim3](https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3) via the `campaign2ensemble` subroutine.

## Installation
Simply type `fab localhost install_plugin:FabUQCampaign` anywhere inside your FabSim3 install directory.

## Explanation of files
+ `FabUQCampaign/FabUQCampaign.py`: contains the `run_UQ_sample` subroutine in which the job properties are specified, e.g. number of cores, memory, wall-time limit etc
+ `FabUQCampaign/templates/run_UQ_sample`: contains the command-line execution command for a single EasyVVUQ sample.
+ `FabUQCampaign/examples/ocean_2D/`: an example script, see below.

## Detailed Examples

### Executing an ensemble job on localhost
In the examples folder there is a script which runs an EasyVVUQ Stochastic Collocation (SC) campaign using FabSim3 for a 2D ocean model on a square domain with periodic boundary conditions. Essentially, the governing equations are the Navier-Stokes equations written in terms of the vorticity ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Comega) and stream function ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CPsi), plus an additional forcing term F:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cnabla%5E2%5CPsi%20%3D%20%5Comega)

The viscosities ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu) and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cnu)are the uncertain SC parameters. The script executes the ensemble using FabSim, computes the first two moments of the output, generates some random sample of the SC surrogate and computes the first-order Sobol indices of Pe and f.

The file `run_SC_Fab_campaign.py` contains the main script. The first 4 steps are the same as for an EasyVVUQ campaign that does not use FabSim to execute the runs:
 1. Create an EasyVVUQ campaign object, with `ade_input.json` as argument, which defines the UQ campaign:
 `my_campaign = uq.Campaign(state_filename=input_json)`
 2. Per uncertain parameter, select the input distribution via Chaospy, e.g. `my_campaign.vary_param("Pe", dist=cp.distributions.Uniform(-1, 1))`
 3. Select the SC_Sampler (and specify the polynomial order `p`), which creates a tensor grid from the 1D rules selected in step 2: `sc_sampler = uq.elements.sampling.SCSampler(my_campaign, p)`, and add the runs via `my_campaign.add_runs(sc_sampler, max_num=number_of_samples)`. The `number_of_samples` variable is simply the number of points in the tensor grid.
 4. Create the ensemble run directories which will be used in FabSim's `campaign2ensemble` subroutine: `my_campaign.populate_runs_dir()`
 
Only the fifth step is specific to FabSim. For now, several variables need to be hardcoded, i.e.: 
 + A simulation identifier (`$sim_ID`)
 + Your FabSim home directory (`$fab_home`)
 + The `FabUQCampaign/template/run_UQ_sample` file contains the command line instruction to run a single sample, in this case: `python3 $ade_exec ade_in.json`. Here, `ade_in.json` is just the input file with the parameter values generated by EasyVVUQ. Furthermore, `$ade_exec` is the full path to the Python script which runs the advection diffusion equation at the parameters of `ade_in.json`. It is defined in `deploy/machines_user.yml`, which in this case looks like
 
`localhost:`

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ade_exec: "$fab_home/plugins/FabUQCampaign/examples/advection_diffusion/run_ADE.py"`
 
 The following two commands execute the ensemble run:
 
 1. `cd $fab_home && fab localhost campaign2ensemble:$sim_ID, campaign_dir=$campaign_dir`
 2. `cd $fab_home && fab localhost uq_ensemble:$sim_ID`
 
The run directory `$campaign_dir` is available from the EasyVVUQ object. The `campaign2ensemble` results directory (located in `~/FanSim3/results`) has (by design) the same structure as the EasyVVUQ run directory, so the results can simply be copied back, in this case via

`cp -r ~/FabSim3/results/ade_example1_localhost_16/RUNS/Run_* $campaign_dir/runs`

Afterwards, post-processing tasks in EasyVVUQ can be undertaken, by creating a `SCAnalysis` object: `sc_analysis = uq.elements.analysis.SCAnalysis(my_campaign, value_cols=output_columns)`. Here, `output_columns` is the name of the column in the output CSV file containing the simulation results (u(x) in this case).

+ To compute the mean and variance of the output use: `sc_analysis.get_moments(p)`.  

+ To generate a random output sample from the SC surrogate, use `sc_analysis.surrogate(xi)`, where `xi` is a random Monte Carlo input sample.

+ To compute the Sobol indices from the SC samples, use: `sc_analysis.get_Sobol_indices(typ)`, where `typ` can be `'first_order'` or `'all'`.

### Executing an ensemble job on a remote host

To run the example script on a remote host, every instance of `localhost` must replaced by the `machine_name` of the remote host. Ensure the host is defined in `machines.yml`, and the user login information and `$ade_exec` in `deploy/machines_user.yml`.
