# FabUQCampaign
This plugin runs the samples from an ![EasyVVUQ](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ) campaign using ![FabSim3](https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3) via the `campaign2ensemble` subroutine.

## Installation
Simply type `fab localhost install_plugin:FabUQCampaign` anywhere inside your FabSim3 install directory.

Note that FabUQCampaign relies on EasyVVUQ. As such, make sure you have EasyVVUQ installed.

## Explanation of files
+ `FabUQCampaign/FabUQCampaign.py`: contains the `run_UQ_sample` subroutine in which the job properties are specified, e.g. number of cores, memory, wall-time limit etc.
+ `FabUQCampaign/templates/ade`: contains the command-line execution command for a single EasyVVUQ sample of the advection diffusion equation.
+ `FabUQCampaign/examples/advection_diffusion/*`: an example script, see below.

## Dependencies
+ The example below requires EasyVVUQ >= 0.3

## Detailed Examples

### Inputs
+ As noted, the template `FabUQCampaign/template/ade` contains the command line instruction to run a single sample, in this case: `python3 $ade_exec ade_in.json`. Here, `ade_in.json` is just the input file with the parameter values generated by EasyVVUQ. Furthermore, `$ade_exec` is the full path to the Python script which runs the advection diffusion equation at the parameters of `ade_in.json`. It must be specified in `deploy/machines_user.yml`, which in this case looks like
 
`localhost:`

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ade_exec: "<fab_home>/plugins/FabUQCampaign/examples/advection_diffusion/sc/ade_model.py"`

Here, `<fab_home>` is your FabSim3 home directory.

+ To couple the advection diffusion template to FabUQCampaign, the followin code is added to `FabUQCampaign.py`:
```py
@task
def uq_ensemble_ade(config="dummy_test",**args):
    """
    Submits an advection_diffusion ensemble.
    """
    uq_ensemble(config, 'ade', **args)
```

### Executing an ensemble job on localhost
The governing equations of the advection-diffusion equations are:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bdu%7D%7Bdx%7D%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BPe%7D%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2u%7D%7Bdx%5E2%7D%3Df),

where the Peclet Number (Pe) and forcing term (f) are the uncertain SC parameters, and u is the velocity subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions u(0)=u(1)=0. The script executes the ensemble using FabSim, computes the first two moments of the output, generates some random sample of the SC surrogate and computes the Sobol indices of Pe and f.

The file `examples/advection_diffusion/sc/ade_model.py` contains the finite-element solver which receives the values of Pe and f.  Most steps are exactly the same as for an EasyVVUQ campaign that does not use FabSim to execute the runs:

 1. Create an EasyVVUQ campaign object: `my_campaign = uq.Campaign(name='sc', work_dir=tmpdir)`
 2. Define the parameter space of the ade model, comprising of the uncertain parameters Pe and f, plus the name of the output file of `ade_model.py`:
 
```python
    params = {
        "Pe": {
            "type": "real",
            "min": "1.0",
            "max": "2000.0",
            "default": "100.0"},
        "f": {
            "type": "real",
            "min": "0.0",
            "max": "10.0",
            "default": "1.0"},
        "out_file": {
            "type": "str",
            "default": "output.csv"}}
```
2. (continued): the `params` dict corresponds to the template file `examples/advection_diffusion/sc/ade.template`, which defines the input of a single model run. The content of this file is as follows:
```
{"outfile": "$out_file", "Pe": "$Pe", "f": "$f"}
```
2. (continued): Select which paramaters of `params` are assigned a Chaospy input distribution, and add these paramaters to the `vary` dict, e.g.:

```python
    vary = {
        "Pe": cp.Uniform(100.0, 200.0),
        "f": cp.Normal(1.0, 0.1)
    }
```

3. Create an encoder, decoder and collation element. The encoder links the template file to EasyVVUQ and defines the name of the input file (`ade_in.json`). The ade model `examples/advection_diffusion/sc/ade_model.py` writes the velocity output (`u`) to a simple `.csv` file, hence we select the `SimpleCSV` decoder, where in this case we have a single output column:
```python
    output_filename = params["out_file"]["default"]
    output_columns = ["u"]
    
    encoder = uq.encoders.GenericEncoder(template_fname='./sc/ade.template',
                                         delimiter='$',
                                         target_filename='ade_in.json')
    decoder = uq.decoders.SimpleCSV(target_filename=output_filename,
                                    output_columns=output_columns,
                                    header=0)
    collation = uq.collate.AggregateSamples()
```
 
 4. Now we have to select a sampler, in this case we use the Stochastic Collocation (SC) sampler:
 ```python
     my_sampler = uq.sampling.SCSampler(vary=vary, polynomial_order=3)
     my_campaign.set_sampler(my_sampler)
 ```
 
 4. (continued) If left unspecified, the polynomial order of the SC expansion will be set to 4. If instead we wish te use a Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) sampler, simply replace `SCSampler` with `PCESampler`.
 
 5. The following commands ensure that we draw all samples, and create the ensemble run directories which will be used in FabSim's `campaign2ensemble` subroutine:
 ```python 
     my_campaign.draw_samples()
     my_campaign.populate_runs_dir()
 ```

6. We then use FabSim to run the ensemble via:
 
 ```python
 run_FabUQ_ensemble(my_campaign.campaign_dir)
 ```
6. (continued) the subroutine `run_FabUQ_campaign` is located in the same file as the example script. 

7. Afterwards, post-processing tasks in EasyVVUQ can be undertaken via:
```python
    sc_analysis = uq.analysis.SCAnalysis(sampler=my_sampler, qoi_cols=output_columns)
    my_campaign.apply_analysis(sc_analysis)
    results = my_campaign.get_last_analysis()
```
7. (continued) The `results` dict contains the first 2 statistical moments and Sobol indices for every quantity of interest defined in `output_columns`. If the PCE sampler was used, `SCAnalysis` should be replaced with `PCEAnalysis`.

<!---### Executing an ensemble job on a remote host

To run the example script on a remote host, every instance of `localhost` must replaced by the `machine_name` of the remote host. Ensure the host is defined in `machines.yml`, and the user login information and `$ade_exec` in `deploy/machines_user.yml`.--->
