"""
validate_ensemble_output Validation Pattern.

Purpose: 
1. given an ensemble of validation/verification output directories, it will:
2. operate a sample  testing function on each directory, and
3. print the outputs to screen, and
4. use an aggregation function to combine all outputs into a compound metric.
(printing needs to be done within the testing and aggregation functions themselves).


SPECS of the required sample_testing_function:
- Should operate with a single argument (the simulation output directory).
- ASSUMPTION: There is no explicit argument to indicate where the validation 
  data resides (currently assumed to be packaged with the simulation output 
  and known by the function). -> we could choose to make this explicit.
- The validation function should return a set of metrics.

SPECS of the aggregation_function:
- Receives a Python list with the output of validation_function in each 
  element.
- Returns a data type that represents the compound validation outcome
  (.e.g, one or more error scores).

    Goes through all the output directories and calculates the scores.
    Arguments:
    - results_dirs: list of result dirs to analyse.
    - sample_testing_function: analysis/validation/verification function to be
    performed on each subdirectory of the results_dirs.
    - aggregation_function: function to combine all results
    - **kwargs: custom parameters. The 'items' parameter can be used to give
    explicit ordering of the various subdirectories.
